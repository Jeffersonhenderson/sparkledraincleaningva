Drain Clearing<h2>
Drain clearing is all about removing blockages from your drain lines, sinks, or sewer pipes to make water flow smoothly. We use industrial-grade equipment such as drain augers (powersnakes) and hydrojetting machines to clear all types of clogs.

Drain Auger (Powersnake): Our drain auger, also known as a powersnake, is inserted deep into the drainage system and spins at high speed (RPM) to break blockages inside the pipe. This machine is used for mild clogs that haven’t caused major buildup yet.
Hydrojetting: For stubborn blockages caused by grease, grit, soap scum, or calcium deposits, we use a hydrojetter. It releases a high-pressure stream of water at a powerful flow rate to flush out debris and completely clean the inside of your pipes.

Drain Repair<h2>
At Drain Cleaning #State, we help detect, locate, fix, and restore the proper flow of wastewater within your property. From the drain lines to the main drain that carries wastewater out, our trained eyes and vast experience help us identify when your drain isn’t working as it should. We use CCTV drain cameras and sometimes smoke tests to find blockages, leaks, cracks, root intrusions, and collapsed pipes within the system. Once detected, we fix or replace the damaged drains or pipes and clear any blockages to ensure wastewater is safely and efficiently dispersed off your property for the long term.
%%
Emergency Drain Cleaning Service<h2>
We’re available 24/7 for any drain cleaning service. If you need an inspection, a quick fix, or help clearing clogs from your pipes immediately, we show up. Once you reach out, we’ll connect you with one of our skilled plumbers who will provide the right solution to get your drains flowing again.
For emergency calls, especially on drains we haven’t worked on or maintained before, we carry out a thorough inspection to detect issues and trace their root cause. After that, we fix the problem completely to help ensure it doesn’t resurface anytime soon.
